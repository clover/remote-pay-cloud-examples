# Remote Pay Cloud POS - React

This example is a full-featured, web-based point-of-sale system developed in [React](https://reactjs.org/) that uses the Clover Cloud Connector APIs to perform all POS actions.

You can clone this repository and run the application locally.

    git clone git@github.com:clover/remote-pay-cloud-tutorial.git
    cd remote-pay-cloud-pos-react
    npm run build
    npm start 
    
This will start a local server on port 3000. You can then navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
